## Preparing your experiment

### Step-1
This code is executed in X-fold cross-validation. First, you have to obtain the X-fold cross-validation files using this [code]( https://github.com/cissagatto/CrossValidationMultiLabel). All the instructions to use the code are in the Github. After that, put the results generated in the *datasets* folder in this project as "tar.gz". The folder structure generated by the code CrossValidation is used here. This code don't work without theses files.

### Step-2
A file called _datasets.csv_ must be in the *root project* folder. This file is used to read information about the datasets and they are used in the code. All 74 datasets available in *Cometa* are in this file. If you want to use another dataset, please, add the following information about the dataset in the file:

_Id, Name, Domain, Labels, Instances, Attributes, Inputs, Labelsets, Single, Max freq, Card, Dens, MeanIR, Scumble, TCS, AttStart, AttEnd, LabelStart, LabelEnd, xn, yn, gridn_

The *Id* of the dataset is a mandatory parameter in the command line to run all code. The fields are used in a lot of internal functions. Please, make sure that this information is available before running the code. *xn* and *yn* correspond to a dimension of the quadrangular map for kohonen, and *gridn* is (xn * yn). Example: xn = 4, yn = 4, gridn = 16.


## RUN

To run the code, open the terminal, enter the */MultiLabelSimilaritiesMeasures/R/* folder, and type

```
Rscript mlsm.R [number_dataset] [number_cores] [number_folds] [name_folder_results]
```

Where:

_number_dataset_ is the dataset number in the datasets.csv file

_number_cores_ is the total cores you want to use in parallel execution.

_number_folds_ is the number of folds you want for cross-validation

_name_folders_results_ is the name of the folder to save the results


All parameters are mandatory. Example:

```
Rscript mlsm.R 17 10 10 "/dev/shm/results"
```

This will execute the code for the dataset number 17 in the _dataset.csv_, with 10 cores, 10 folds and the process will be store in the _/dev/shm/results/_. This code automatically makes a copy of the */dev/shm/results* in the folder *Reports* - which is in the root of the project. In this way, you can run the code using a temporary folder, like *scratch* and *shm*, to speed up the execution.


## IMPORTANT
I used ABS function in all functions that used SQRT. Divisions per zero were treated like zero.
